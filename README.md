# PostSearch by Tinda Zaszcek v0.1.0
A simple graphical user interface to search through your old posts.

# About

Download your archive file and use this script to create a local database
of your old posts so you can refurbish and recycle those brilliant hidden
gems on whatever new social media service you end up migrating to.

Features:
    - Parse and organize old posts
    - Search post text
    - TODO: View threaded posts
    - TODO: Automatically import archive ZIP files from Twitter & Threads
    - IDEA: Maybe some organizing features?
    - IDEA: Editing the posts before copying them out?

Note:
    - This is a work in progress, it doesn't work very well yet!
